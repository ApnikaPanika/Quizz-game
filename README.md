# Printful homework by Toms Bude

This is printful homework, and the task was to make a functional quiz app.

I made it pretty simple, all the parts of the quiz are in the components map, but the logic is in the App.vue file.

To start my project all you need is, to open my project in the code editor, then open terminal, and write two commands:

```
npm install
```
and

```
npm run serve
```


If something doesn't work I would suggest running this command:
### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
or follow the recommendations in your terminal

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
