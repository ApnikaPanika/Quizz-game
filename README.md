# Printful homework by Toms Bude

This is printful homework, and the task was to make functional quizz app. 

I made it pretty simple, all the parts of the quizz are in the components map, but the logic is in the App.vue file. To start my project all you need is, to open the Terminal and write two commands:

```
npm install
```
and

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
